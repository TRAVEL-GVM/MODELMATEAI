# ModelMateAI

**ModelMateAI** is a **Streamlit** tool used to analyse and interact with recorded **Findings**, **Obligations**, and **Recommendations** related to Internal Risk Models under Models Committee management.

Its primary goal is to centralize and analyse recorded activities that would otherwise not be captured by Internal Control's WFMII system ‚Äî such as findings related to models not yet in production or recommendations that wouldn‚Äôt be registered on time (e.g., regarding draft ECB decisions).

An integration with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** was implemented to allow natural language interaction with the findings, enabling easier access, deeper understanding, and visual exploration of the data.
