# ModelMateAI

**ModelMateAI** is a **Streamlit** tool used to analyse and interact with recorded **Findings**, **Obligations**, and **Recommendations** related to Internal Risk Models under Models Committee management.

Its primary goal is to centralize and analyse recorded activities that would otherwise not be captured by Internal Control's WFMII system — such as findings related to models not yet in production or recommendations that wouldn’t be registered on time (e.g., regarding draft ECB decisions).

An integration with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** was implemented to allow natural language interaction with the findings, enabling easier access, deeper understanding, and visual exploration of the data.
