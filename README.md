# ModelMateAI

ModelMateAI is a streamlit tool used to analyse recorde Findings, Obligations and Recommendations related with Internal Risk Model under Models Committee management.

Its primary goal is to hold and analyse recorded activities that would otherwise not be registered with Internal Control's WFMII (findings related to models that are not yet in production or recommendations) or which registry would not occur in a timely manner (regarding draft ECB decisions, for example).

An integration was made to LLM Models, which allows a more human interaction with the Findings and opens possibilities for their full understanding.
